# How to contribute

Third-party patches are essential for keeping every project great.
We simply can't access the huge number of use cases.
We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that get things working in your environment.
There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

## Getting started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Work on an existing [Issues](https://github.com/zeroasterisk/react-uniforms-widgets/issues)
* Submit a new issue for a *bug* or *feature request*, assuming one does not already exist.

### Tips on Issue Creation

* Include a brief summary, bullet lists are often better than paragraphs
* Include all basic OS, tools, and package version numbers
* For a bug, including steps to reproduce
* For a feature request, communicate the value and approach

## Making changes

* Create a fork from where you want to base your work.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format:
    * Bugfix:
        * `Asynchronous validation (closes #17).`
        * `Skip onSubmit until rendered (closes #15).`
    * Other changes:
        * `Refactoring core package.`
        * `Updated README.`
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Make sure your code passes *all* tests:
    * `npm test`
